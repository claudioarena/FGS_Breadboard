*Py-Hardware-Support* - A collection of python modules for common laboratory hardware
=====================================================================================

Here's a small collection of some python modules that can be used to add hardware support to your programs. 
I have written those to be easy to use, but they are not necessarily covering all the functionality the 
library or device has to offer. 

Currently included hardware:
   * Princeton Instruments PICam library
   * Ophir's USBI interface for power meters
   * Thorlabs' uc480 CCD and CMOS cameras

As I am browsing through my old code, I will constantly be adding more modules / hardware to this repository.

How to use these modules
========================

In order to use one of these modules in your own scripts, simply copy the respective folder 
somewhere into your project tree where python is looking for modules and use standard module import. 
Examples are given for each module.

Documentation
